# DrugD
The Drug Candidate Exploration Hub is a powerful cheminformatics web server built with Python's RDKit and Streamlit, designed to accelerate early-stage drug discovery through virtual screening and molecular analysis. This interactive platform enables researchers to screen compound libraries using multiple fingerprint methods (Morgan, MACCS, RDKit), detect structural alerts (PAINS, Brenk, NIH filters), and analyze molecular properties through an intuitive interface. Developed at DES Pune University, it combines robust computational chemistry algorithms with accessible visualization tools, allowing both experts and non-programmers to perform similarity searches, scaffold hopping, and lead optimization without coding. The server's efficient processing pipeline handles batch compound analysis while maintaining data security, making it valuable for academic labs and pharmaceutical researchers exploring new chemical space for drug development.
